# Anti-GameRage
Send joy (instead of hate) to your opponent.
(originally designed for Valorant, but should work on other games)

Run the python file, write your text and then press your shortcut (ctrl+t) by default to turn hate into joy !
In the python file you can change the shortcut and enable/disable autosend.
